# Snake
The classic game of snake designed using the turtle module.


## Setup
Clone this repository to a local directory. Refer to [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for more guidance.

Next, you should install the neccessary packages to run **main.py**: *turtle,* and *time*. You can install these using **pip**:
```
- pip install turtle
```
```
- pip install time
```

Now your setup is complete!

## Running the Code
To run the code, run **main.py**. This will open up the turtle window and display the snake graphics.

To control the snake, make use of the arrows key on the keyboard.

That's pretty much all you need to play the game. Enjoy!
